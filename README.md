Problem statement: Anomaly detection in crowd through smartphone dataset

Objective: Anomaly detection in crowd behavior using smartphone datasets means identifying unusual patterns or behaviors among individuals in a crowd. Smartphones, installed with various sensors like GPS, accelerometers, cameras, and gyroscopes, collect extensive data that can be analyzed to monitor movement, location, and activity. By applying machine learning algorithms and statistical methods to this data, anomalies such as sudden stops, erratic movements, or unexpected gatherings can be detected. This process helps in enhancing public safety, managing crowds in real-time, and preventing potential hazards. Effective anomaly detection leverages both the diversity and richness of smartphone data to provide timely and accurate insights.
